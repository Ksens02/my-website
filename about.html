    <h2>Who I Am</h2>
    <p>
      I'm a cybersecurity student with a passion for offensive security, packet analysis, and system-level problem solving.
      I’m currently interning on a DevSecOps team, where I work with AWS, Atlassian, and GitLab to help improve security in CI/CD pipelines.
      Also, I am a full time student athlete at Mercyhurst University. I am currently working on my Bachelor's in cybersecurity with minor's in Data Science and Business administration, 
      as well as my Master's in cybersecurity.
      As I said before, I am an athlete at Mercyhurst, where I compete on our Division I Men's Water Polo Team.

    <h2>Why I Built This Site</h2>
    <p>
      This site is a personal knowledge hub — a way for me to document my journey, reflect on what I’ve learned, and showcase my skills. Also, this site in itself is a personal project
      for learning web development via HTML and CSS. Furthermore, I am practicing hosting this site using Docker, web servers (Nginx, Uniform Web Server), and Cloudflare Tunneling. This site as whole
      is a project in which I am combining, and applying, several different cyber skills I have learned over the last few years.
